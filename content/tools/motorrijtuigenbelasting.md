### Dutch road tax python package

Motorrijtuigenbelasting is a Python library designed to calculate Dutch road taxes (motorrijtuigenbelasting, MRB) for passenger cars, motorcycles, and other vehicle types. It provides tools for determining taxes based on weight, fuel type, and provincial rates between 2015 and 2024. Future years will be added once the inflation numbers are in from the Belastingdienst.

#### Features
Support for multiple energy sources (benzine, diesel, LPG, electric, etc.)
Handles tax calculations based on weight brackets and provincial multipliers.
Adjustable tax parameters for future tax years.
Lightweight and extensible for different vehicle types like cars and motorcycles.
