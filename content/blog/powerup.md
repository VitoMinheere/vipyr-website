# I Completed the Microsoft Power Up Program! 🚀

Over the past months, I took part in Microsoft’s **Power Up Program** a free, guided learning journey into the world of **low-code development using Power Platform**. The course is aimed at people with a technical background who want to upskill and explore what Microsoft’s Power Platform ecosystem has to offer.

I'm happy to share that I **completed the course and passed the final challenge!**

To help others along the way, I created a series of **six YouTube videos** sharing my progress, impressions, and final project. You’ll find the full playlist linked below 👇

## 🎯 What the Course Covers

The Power Up Program is structured around key parts of the Power Platform:

1. **Dataverse & Data Modeling** – Learning how to structure your data and work with relationships.
2. **Canvas Apps** – Building user interfaces using drag-and-drop, and wiring it all up with PowerFX.
3. **Power Automate** – Creating flows for automation across apps and services.
4. **Final Challenge** – A realistic business scenario where you design, build, and submit your own solution.

Each module builds on the previous one, with hands-on labs and optional live Q&As.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Some of my key takeaways:

- **Dataverse** is more powerful than it looks — especially once you understand table relationships and lookup columns.
- **Canvas Apps** can be very quick to prototype, but **PowerFX** has a learning curve, especially with its Excel-like syntax.
- **Power Automate** is intuitive for simple flows, but needs patience when debugging or handling branching logic.
- The **final challenge** gave me a chance to apply everything in a real-world scenario which was both the most valuable and most satisfying part of the course.

## 👨‍💻 Final Thoughts

This course was a great introduction to the Power Platform. While I still prefer code-first approaches for most projects, I now have a much better understanding of how and when **low-code tools** like Power Apps and Power Automate can speed up delivery — especially for internal business tools.

If you're curious about the Power Platform, or thinking about joining a future round of the Power Up Program, I highly recommend giving it a shot.
